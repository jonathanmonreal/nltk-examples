These are my examples for the Natural Language Processing with Python book by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein & Edward Loper published by Oâ€™Reilly in 2009.

I have given many questions their own .py file to better break up the code.

Because I would like to make the material in this repository accessible to others that read the book, I have included comments even where they may be beyond the scope of normal commenting and I have tried to not use concepts such as regular expressions until they are introduced.

I am not associated with the book, its publisher, or its authors.
